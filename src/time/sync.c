/**
 * @file sync.c
 * @brief Time synchonization function implementation
 * 
 * Time synchronization is implemented as a state machine. The time 
 * synchronization state is stored in tm_sync_sm, and contains the 
 * state as a uint8_t and the following timestamps as tm_system_t: 
 *  - t1  - first sync timestamp provided by the master
 *  - t1p - local time on receipt of the first sync timestamp
 *  - t2  - timestamp read by the master for delay calculation
 *  - t2p - master timestamped reception of t2
 * 
 * The state machine is executed on reciept of the last synchronization 
 * register from the host. 
 * 
 * When the delay out timestamp is read from the host (t2), it needs to 
 * read one extra register. The final register read is the trigger we 
 * use to record our copy.
 * 
 * 
 * @see sync.h
